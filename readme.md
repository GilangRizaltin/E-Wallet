Introducing a digital wallet that's not just about transactions but a seamless journey in the digital realm. It empowers users with features like peer-to-peer transfers, easy top-ups, and a comprehensive transaction history tracker. This project, a collaborative team effort, unfolded its magic over a dynamic week, following the agile SCRUM methodology. Fueled by defined requirements, our goal was clear, and the result is a digital wallet experience that goes beyond just handling money â€“ it fosters a connection between users and their financial journey.
